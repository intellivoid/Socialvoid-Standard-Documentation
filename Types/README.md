# Types

In Socialvoid, objects or states may be the same but the type may be 
different. For instance, a peer could be the following Types; `USER`,
`PROXY_ACCOUNT` or `BOT`. They may return the same peer object but the
type indicates that they operate differently or have a different set of
functions.
